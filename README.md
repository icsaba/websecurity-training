# hacks

I am learning websecurity from [portswigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/) and i try to create tools that can help me during labs instead of using their software.
(actually i dont really want to install it on my mac 👨‍💻)

## cache poisoning

I finished the [first lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting/lab-web-cache-poisoning-with-an-unkeyed-header) where we had to inject malicious url through `X-Forwarded-Host`.

run `node cache-poison.js` from terminal.
